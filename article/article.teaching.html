			<p>Textbook: <strong>Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners</strong> by Christof Paar and Jan Pelzl </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p>This course offers a landscape overview of cryptography from ancient word tricks to modern day algorithms. Instead of putting weights on discrete math inductions, this course focuses on the rationale behind the evolution of cryptographic techniques and how these techniques support historical and modern applications. Every year, this course updates itself to keep up with the frontier of cryptography research and adds fresh ingredients into the syllabus. Modules such as POODLE attacks and SM series ciphers are already included in the past year teaching.</p>
